## Description

This is an application that is meant to give a user insight into his or her pantry. They can choose to add items manually in the dashboard, or select one of the suggestions the API gives the user to get more detailed information of the selected ingredient. In the dashboard the user also receives live information about the expiry status of their pantry items.

The user also has the option to manage their shopping list within this application, they can add items directly from their pantry to the shopping list, or add them manually in the dashboard. Here too the API will suggest items, picking one of these will provide the application with a more detailed item.

Finally the application will make recipe suggestions to the user based on ingredients available in the pantry. The application will prioritize ingredients that are about to expire for the selection of these recipes. The user can however influence these suggestions with the parameters provided in the dashboard. If none of the suggestions are to the user's liking they can re-apply the parameters in the dashboard and receive a new selection for as long as there are API requests available, or they can search for their desired dish directly using the searchbar.

When the user has found a recipe they like, they can add it to their selection, which will be shown in the "My recipes" page. On this page the user will also receive information on whether they have all ingredients to cook their chosen recipes available, or if a shopping trip is still needed.
